# TrashTalk üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TrashTeam


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Indrajith S Nair - St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai

### Project Description
TrashTalk is a web-based app where users showcase their most pointless items. Other users rate these items on a scale from 1-10, with 10 being the most useless. The app features a leaderboard showcasing the most useless items and their proud owners.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People struggle to showcase their utterly useless items in a meaningful way and lack a competitive platform to prove their item‚Äôs pointlessness.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôve built TrashTalk: a platform to share your most absurd possessions, get them rated, and claim your place on the ‚ÄúMost Useless‚Äù leaderboard!
